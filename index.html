		        	<li>We'll validate these products by collecting emails from your followers that are interested before we create any units</li>
		        	<li>We'll start to monetize by launching your new brand on Amazon.com, obtaining the first 50 reviews from your followers, and landing on the first page for your keyword</li>

		        This is my personal sales history over the past year. $80,000 of these sales have come from one simple product with no audience behind it.

		        The best social media monitizers are already monitizing their audiences through the creation of physical products. Examples are everywhere, however I will focus on Jocko Willink's product line as he went from complete obscurity to consistent sales much faster than most of us.

		        <h3>
		        Jocko Willink was a US Navy SEAL commander for more than 20 years, and prior to Dec. 1st 2015 he had never been available in the public. No interviews, no TV shows, no social media. He appeared on Joe Rogan's podcast, created his own podcast, and then created a followbase of ~100K people by September 2016 when he launched his first Amazon products.

				<h3>
				Jocko WIllink launched a private label line of White Pomogranite Tea and immediately sold out of all of his units. He ordered more, and immediately sold out when they arrived in Amazon's warehouse. They have not sold out since then, but the image above with the chart data shows that this past month with nearly no promotion the products have sold close to $14,000. These are atypical results based on a combination of a social media platform, an engaged audience, and a product which adds value to the seller and the buyer.
